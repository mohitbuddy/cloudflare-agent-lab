Welcome to the **Cloudflare Agent Lab**! This repository hosts a serverless AI agent built using Cloudflare Workers, KV storage, and LLaMA 3 inference. It provides a range of endpoints for health checks, Q&A, webhooks, and external API routing. With KV storage, the agent maintains lightweight memory and state management, ensuring efficiency and speed. The deployment process is automated through GitHub Actions, allowing for a minimal, fast, and production-grade edge deployment.
